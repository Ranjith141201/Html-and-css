<h1>Taj Mahal</h1>

<p><font size=5">Taj Mahal needs no introduction. This monument is on the list of the Seven Wonders of the World.<br>
 No wonder people swarm in flies all year round to witness the magnificence of his beauty.<br> 
This monument is located in India in the city of Agra in Uttar Pradesh.<br> 
In other words, Taj Mahal marks the excellence of Mughal architecture.
</p>

<p><font size=5">
Taj Mahal is one of the main reasons why India is famous. Many people even associate India with Taj Mahal.<br>
 However, to me, more than the splendid architecture, it is the story behind it that appeals to me the most.<br>
 This magnificent beauty stands strong as a symbol of the love of a husband to his wife. <br>
Moreover, it reminds us of the power of love and how it can set an example for generations to come.<br>
</p>

<p><font size=5">
To honor the memory of his loving wife, Shah Jahan ordered the finest artisans from all over the world to build it.<br>
He wanted to make something that had never been done before for anyone.<br>
 The emperor wished to give the last gift to his wife whom he loved very much.<br>

<h2> Gol Gumbaz </h2>
<p><font size=5">
Gol Gumbaz is the most famous monument in Vijayapura. It is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah (ruled 1627–1657). <br>
It is the second largest dome ever built, next in size only to St Peter’s Basilica in Rome. <br>
 A particular attraction in this monument is the central chamber, where every sound is echoed seven times. <br>
</p>

<p><font size=5">
 Another attraction at the Gol Gumbaz is the Whispering Gallery, where even minute sounds can be hear clearly 37 metres away. <br>
Gol Gumbaz complex includes a mosque, a Naqqar Khana (a hall for the trumpeters) (now it is used as museum) and the ruins of guest houses.<br>
</p>


<p><font size=5">
Its vast dome is said to be the Second Largest Dome, unsupported by pillars, in the world, after St. Peter’s in the Vatican City of Rome.<br>
It is constructed in such a way that even a pin drop can be heard distinctly from across a space of 38 m, in the Whispering Gallery. <br>
The acoustics here are such that any sound made is said to be repeated 10 times over. In the surrounding ornamental gardens is an archeological museum.<br>

<h2>Red Fort</h2>
<p><font size=5">
From Akbar to Jahangir, India was under the Mughal dynasty for many years and had witnessed various changes in the country.
 Various invaders ruled India, but the Mughals ruled over India for about four hundred years.
</p>

<p><font size=5">
During these periods, the Mughals have advanced their artistic abilities and have constructed many historical monuments in Delhi and Agra.
 One of the most prominent monuments is the Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, which signifies the Mughal powers.
 It is well known for its architecture and other unique features. 
</p>


<p><font size=5">
 The Red Fort was built by the famous Mughal ruler Shah Jahan in the year 1648. The foundation stone was laid in 1639, and it took almost nine years to be fully constructed.
 The fort is made up of red sandstone and marble, which makes it unique among other historical monuments. 
The Red Fort is located on the banks of the Yamuna river and opposite to the Chandni Chowk market.
